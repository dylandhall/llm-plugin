# LLM Chrome plugin

Latest release at: https://github.com/dylandhall/llm-plugin/releases

Just download the crx file and add it as an extension in Chrome.

## What it is

This is designed to work with ChatGpt compatible APIs, including a local LM Studio or llama.cpp server.

Allows you to process webpages with configurable, custom prompts, and follow up with chat to ask questions about the page. Data is persisted so you can have longer chats asking questions in detail about sites.

I had forked a different repo and tried to expand it with an LLM and it was horrific, so I started from scratch with this one, and it's hand coded and works a lot better. I hope it's helpful.

Use Ctrl-B to toggle the chat input. I have plans to make it a sidebar app and allow follow on chat adding info from more websites. If you highlight text, it will use that instead of the entire page.
